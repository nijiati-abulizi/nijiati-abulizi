## ðŸ”¬ Projects

### 1. **Benchmarking and Predicting Mental Health Scores**
This capstone project, done in collaboration with Greenspace Health, focuses on predicting and benchmarking PHQ-9 scores over time. Models such as Generalized Additive Models (GAM), XGBoost, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) were used to enhance the accuracy of mental health outcome predictions and provide better insights into patient progress.

### 2. **Comparative Evaluation of Pretrained Models for Lung Disease Classification**
This project explores deep learning models for classifying lung diseases using chest X-ray images. It compares VGG16 with EfficientNetV2 models and evaluates the effect of optimizers like Adam and AdamW. The objective is to improve diagnostic accuracy across multiple disease classes.

### 3. **Understanding Diabetes Risk**
Analyzed health data from 250,000+ individuals using machine learning models to uncover key risk factors for diabetes. The findings support better health policy decision-making and promote preventive care based on lifestyle and clinical indicators.

### 4. **Methylation-Based Survival Modeling**
Built Cox and Random Survival Forest models to predict patient survival outcomes using methylation and genomic features. Conducted SHAP analysis and pathway enrichment to identify critical biomarkers for cancer progression.

### 5. **Discover Your Music Taste Dashboard**
An interactive Streamlit dashboard built with Spotify API, allowing users to explore their music preferences, identify top genres, and visualize audio features like tempo, energy, and danceability.

### 6. **Milk Quality Prediction**
Developed classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest to predict milk quality based on chemical attributes. Random Forest yielded the highest accuracy, with detailed feature importance insights.

### 7. **YelpViz**
A Python app that connects to Yelpâ€™s API to fetch and visualize local business data. Useful for exploring trends, ratings, and business distributions across locations.

### 8. **Quizzer App**
A lightweight app for creating and managing quizzes. Designed with modularity and ease-of-use in mind, it's perfect for educational environments and self-assessments.
